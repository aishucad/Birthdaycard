                special day. You are a friend that loves completely and believes in true friendship. Every day can be
                your birthday, but today remains memorable, don’t forget to make it a beautiful day. Happy birthday.<br>

                (sister), I wish you a happy birthday.<br>

                because you are priceless. I can’t recount all we have been through together because you have been a
                superhero in those situations. I want to scream to the entire world that you are the best thing that
                happened to me. Happy birthday.<br>

                I celebrate the birthday of a genius, the best of its kind. You are a treasure to humanity, and I

                if we fight on who is right or wrong. I know that they are the reasons I adore you as my best friend
                forever. Happy birthday, friend.<br>

                There are only but two types of people in the world: family and friends. You fit in every part that
                relates to me and has never let me down. You are my one in a million, and I can’t love you lesser than I
                do already. Our friendship will stand the test of time, and nothing will ever break us. Happy birthday,
                my friend.<br>

                You are my muse and my blood. Things we have been through together will bond us forever. Let me
                appreciate you for always looking out for me. For being that other part of me that pushes me to be
                better than I used to be. You are special, and I am grateful for every inch of the blessing you brought
                into my life. Happy birthday (Happy birthday messages for my friend)<br>

                If everyone on earth has this same awesome set of people like you as friends, then the world would
                be filled with love. You are amazing in every ramification. What else do I need when I have you? Today
                is that time of the year again, Let’s make it memorable because you are special.<br>

                Happy birthday, my friend. The only one I can count on to be there for me at all times. My best
                friend, you are everything in one. A brother and a sister, a mentor and a counselor. You are caring and
                loving so, therefore, let’s rock today like no other day. Happy birthday, dear.<br>

                Sometimes, I wonder what I have done to deserve such a considerate friend as you are. You are
                everything meshed up in one. You are the most significant person in my life, and you never got to that
                position by luck but by the beautiful things you have done for me. Happy birthday, my friend.<br>

                I will flaunt you to the world because you will always have my back on anything. Despite the fights,
                I never doubt or wonder on whose side you are, on issues concerning me with other persons. You will have
                many more years of robust health and joy. Happy birthday. </p>
